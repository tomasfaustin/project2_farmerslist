Do you know where your food comes from? If you don't, you should!

farmerslist connects farmers growing organic and sustainable products with customers who can't get to the farmers markets or want to level up from the grocery store.

farmerslist allows the good folks growing food to post on a public forum in a way that let's their community know what's available, for how much, and where they can find it.

Just remember, everything is negotiable, so haggle away!
