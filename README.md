#FARMERSLIST

##INTRODUCTION

Do you know where your food comes from? If you don't, you should! **FARMERSLIST** connects farmers growing conventional and organic products with customers who want to bypass the grocery store or can't get to the farmers markets.

**FARMERSLIST** allows the good folks growing food to post on a public forum in a way that let's the general public know what's available, how much, and what it costs. Just remember, everything is negotiable!
